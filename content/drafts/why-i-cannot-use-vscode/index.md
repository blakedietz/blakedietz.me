## VSCode is not the IDE for me

### Out of the box configs

### Vcs

#### File diff view

There's no easy way that I can tell to revert blocks of changes.

#### Interactive rebase

#### Changelists

### DB

#### Query Console support

Extremely ergonomic to have queries and code all in one location

### Local history

This has saved my ass numerous times.
