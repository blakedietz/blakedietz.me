## Let's start with a definition

I know the title sounds a little like jargon. I wasn't sure what else to use as an alternative for "context" because it can apply to so many different contexts (tee hee). When I refer to context I mean any state associated with a decision or decisions when creating a solution to a problem. Someone's thoughts, cultural norms, the current codebase or the emotions of the person are all valid parts of a context. Context is composed of the innumerable pieces that can impact how a solution is created for a given problem at a point in time as well as throughout the time that the solution evolves.

## Why should you be interested in reverse engineering context

Reverse engineering context is a very important skill for software development. It requires a mixture technical and soft skills in order to do it well. Understanding the context in which a solution was created can yield valuable insights into how or why something was built and can shed light on how you redesign your software systems.

Even then when you think you've successfully reverse engineered some solution there's still no way to know that you've reached perfect truth. At best you'll have a rough guess at worst, you may have learned more about the people, systems and processes that contribute to your code base.
