### Treefort music fest

I worked on the Treefort music festival mobile application and backing api for a few years as a volunteer.

### Built and deployed serverless apis

I wrote the backing api in AWS Lambda, Dynamodb and APIGateway. During the last two years the api handled over 1m 
requests within the festival timeframe each year. The api had an etl process that gathered backing data. There was 
also a ci/cd pipeline for each environment to enable iterative feature development.

### Hybrid application development

I helped write the first iteration of the application in the Ionic framework. We were tasked with maintaining and 
rewriting the application and decided to go with a hybrid solution. This allowed us to write code that was deployed
to both iOS and Android.
