### Nested tags

### kbd-prettier

Make your keyboard layouts pretty ‚å®Ô∏èüíÖ‚ú®.

This tool automatically makes your keyboard layout uniform. That's right, no more updating your layouts by hand after you make changes. Just create a layout in the layouts.json file and add the necessary directives to your layout blocks then run the script against the keymap you want to prettify. For an added bonus, add a watcher script to your editor of choice to have the layouts get automatically prettified upon save.

### Treefort music fest

I worked on the Treefort music festival mobile application and backing api for a few years as a volunteer.

### Built and deployed serverless apis

I wrote the backing api in AWS Lambda, Dynamodb and APIGateway. During the last two years the api handled over 1m
requests within the festival timeframe each year. The api had an etl process that gathered backing data. There was
also a ci/cd pipeline for each environment to enable iterative feature development.

### Hybrid application development

I helped write the first iteration of the application in the Ionic framework. We were tasked with maintaining and
rewriting the application and decided to go with a hybrid solution. This allowed us to write code that was deployed
to both iOS and Android.

## Who am I

I'm a software developer that lives in Boise, ID. I have a [partner](https://instagram.com/allyan_na) and a [pupper](https://instagram.com/velo.dog) that I spend my spare time with. I'm a life long learner, that spends way too much time tinkering. My hobbies include vintage pen restoration, keyboard building, mountain biking, kombucha brewing and lifting.
