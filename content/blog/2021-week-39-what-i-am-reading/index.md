## Journaling

I've been meaning to journal more and with my Remarkable 2, I have no excuses to not make it a daily habit. I also can't count the number of times that I've had to go dig up [this great discussion on daily journaling][daily-journaling]. I've only just started but hope to make it a part of my routine as it's been quite cathartic thus far.

## Functional programming

### Journal of functional programming

While reading the documentation for [koka][koka-docs] I stumbled upon [the Journal of Functional programming][journal-fp]. While I doubt I have the depth of knowledge to understand most of the content, I'm happy to know the resource exists and plan on trying to read through a few papers at some point in the future.

### Functional programming languages

I'm always interested in learning more about functional programming, perhaps a bit too much. Over the last few weeks I've been perusing a few functional programming languages docs. Those languages are:

- [koka][koka-docs]
- [grain][grain-docs]
- [gleam][gleam-docs]

Koka seems the most interesting out of the three. Grain seems to be the most nascent considering that they're currently rewriting the dom standard library right now.

### Type level programming

## API design

## Concepts

### Kayfabe

My friends Chris and Albert introduced me to [The Portal][the-portal] podcast and I have been enjoying the content thus far. Weinstein, the host, introduced an interesting term called ["kayfabe"][kayfabe] in one of the podcasts. It's a wonderful tool to help understand the world as it is today.
