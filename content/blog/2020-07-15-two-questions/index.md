I've come to develop a tradition for myself over the last few years. Normally I wouldn't consider myself a traditional
person. I hate doing things for the sake of doing them. Yet, I've found that there's nothing wrong with establishing
your own traditions as long as there's good reason.

I found one good reason to ask everyone two questions on their birthday, and it's completely selfish. I figured I would
try to distill or extract the most valuable things that a person has learned within the last year, for
my own benefit of course. I mean, imagine if you could distill the knowledge of all of your close friends and family
into a guide for yourself. Imagine all the concepts and learnings that you could apply to your own life. Well,
I've found myself asking friends, family and strangers two questions on their birthday.

> What's your favorite memory from last year?
>
> What's the most important thing that you learned in the last year?

I love both of them because they're both simple. One is intellectual, usually, and the other is emotional. The first
question allows you to pry at the most formative moments of the last year while the other gives you some concrete
takeaways.

I've become known for asking these questions enough where even I receive the same queries each year.

Here are my responses for last year:

## My response from last year

> Me: That when someone acts in a way that's surprising to you in the moment, but it aligns with the way they've behaved
> in the past, you shouldn't be surprised by their actions. You know.

Here are the responses from Albert Wintermote (my partner (Allyanna Wintermote's father)) for this year:

## Albert's response from this year
