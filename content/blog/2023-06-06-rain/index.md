Today finally brought showers to Boise. It was more lighting and thunder than we've seen in as far back as I can remember for this area. Allyanna and I were finishing up the season finale of Barry when we found ourselves pausing the show and turning around to watch the pink and yellow sky as we counted the seconds between each flash and boom. There are few places I'd rather be.


Here's a nice audio clip of the storm rolling through.
