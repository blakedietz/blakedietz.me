Spotify created a new feature called [daily mix](https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/search_play/daily-mix/). It's like discover weekly, but it's created **every single day**. The feature has been rolled out to mobile, but it hasn't made it to desktop quite yet. Here are some pro tips to make sure you maximize your listening pleasure:

- Create a folder name daily-mix.
- Save your favorite daily mixes to this folder as a new playlist. This is because your mixes will most likely get overwritten each day.
- Enjoy the machine dj overlord's dank music selection.

It doesn't seem like there is currently a way to automate saving each daily mix via IFTTT. I'll update later if I can scrape together a script to do this on a daily basis.
