## Self diagnosis

First off, I want to say that I have not been diagnosed by a professional. The keyword in the title is _might_. While I don't have an explicit diagnosis, I do have a lot of personal evidence. As with any health issue, I always recommend that you find a doctor and request their professional opinion. With that said, you are your own physical and mental health champion and I encourage you to continue learning about any conditions that may impact your life and advocating for yourself and your primary care provider.
