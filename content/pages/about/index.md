# 🪴 This site 🌿

This site is more of a digital garden than it is a blog. I post here more as a way of solidifying my knowledge than in hopes of garnering an audience. The process of publishing something has a sort of effect on turning the conceptual into the concrete; perhaps it's the writing process, or perhaps it's knowing that it might be public. Either way, if you do end up finding this garden helpful, that's even better. 😄
