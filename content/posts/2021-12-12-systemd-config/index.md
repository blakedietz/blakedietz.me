## Define a service file

Defining the following ensures that even after system restart your service is restarted

```
# /lib/systemd/system/torrent_top_10.service
[Unit]
Description=Run top 10 torrent service
# wait until the network is available
After=network.target

[Service]
# run the binary that was generated by mix release
ExecStart=/home/pi/redacted-discord-bot/redacted-discord-bot-main/_build/prod/rel/app/bin/app start
User=pi
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Create a mix release

```bash
# Before doing this make sure your environment has the necessary variables that are accessible. I recommend using direnv to manage this
MIX_ENV=prod mix release
```

## Tell systemd about the new changes

```bash
# Reload the daemon (pronounce it with me de-mon) so it picks up on the .service file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Start your new service
sudo systemctl start torrent_top_10

# Check the status of the service to make sure it's healthy
sudo systemctl status torrent_top_10
# Here's some example output
● torrent_top_10.service - Run top 10 torrent service
