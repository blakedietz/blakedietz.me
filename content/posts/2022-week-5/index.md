## What I'm thinking about

### Suboptimal defaults

I've been thinking about default configurations that don't make sense. Things like desk layout, editor orientation and gaming keyboard mappings often don't make much sense by default.

## What I'm working on

### Better communicating work with my partner Allyanna

Allyanna and I have been trying to better organize work between the two of us. There's nothing like finding a groove as a couple by knowing what we're both working on. We've been doing couple's scrum for years on and off and have decided to get back into it by setting up a new kanban board. We've been picking off tickets consistently and it feels good.

## What I'm reading

### Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life

Didn't get as far as I would have liked this week, but that's okay.

## What I'm watching

### Righteous Gemstones

[Season two of "Righteous Gemstones"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8634332/) was released.

## What I'm listening to

### Weval: Changed for the better
