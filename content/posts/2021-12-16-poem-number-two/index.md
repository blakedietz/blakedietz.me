There was a challenge in the book "Toilet Tag'. It's a cute product that you place on the toilet. Each page is filled with a question or challenge that is to be answered while on the toilet. That player fills it out and waits for responses to the same challenge from other players who fill it out while sitting on the toilet. One of the prompts was to write a poem about poop, so here ya go ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The poem is titled "Poem number two"

poop is the gloop that flows from your cheeks

sometimes it smells

sometimes it reeks

the throne compels

sitting for extended spells

often to the point

where you can't feel your feet
