## Dactyl manuform 4 x 5 build guide

The dactyl manuform is an open source ergonomic split keyboard.

⚠️⚠️WORK IN PROGRESS⚠️⚠️

This guide is a work in progress. I'm currently working through building it so don't take it as gospel until it's done. I'd rather publish things incrementally than leave it all until the very end to make sure I capture all of my thoughts.
