The other day I was riding from the Idaho Youth ranch after making a donation. I ended up stumbling upon a new food truck.

The eatery goes by Antojitos El Cabazazo! It's located at 340 N Orchard St Boise, Idaho 83706.

We ended up grabbing a handful of tacos. My favorite was the chorizo by far. If you're near the Central Bench, go give a shot. The owners are kind, and the food is wonderful.
