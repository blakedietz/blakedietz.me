I've been tickled by how delightful Amazing Marvin's user experience is. The developers of Amazing Marvin consistently go above and beyond when implementing features. They carefully tailor the experience for the user, sometimes eschewing common design patterns and adding their own flare for even the smallest interactions. If you're looking for a task management system I highly recommend giving https://amazingmarvin.com/ a try.

My favourite UI so far is the task list. In particular, the hover functionality of the list is the most interesting design choice.

## Example

## Why this is an elegant UI

### Fewer number of steps

The typical task list will have one or two points in the UI to add a new task. This will typically be a top level button outside the task list as well as a ghost row inlined in the task list. With both of these UI elements you must first click the element, type your text and then drag the element into the order that you want it to be in.

Typical task list UX

- Find one of two creation control elements
- Click the element
- Find the new element in the list that was added
- Type the text for the newly created item
- Drag the element to the row in the list that you want it to be in

Amazing Marvin task list UX

- Find the element you want your new task to be above or below
- Click the top or bottom plus sign
- Type the text

### Less context switching
