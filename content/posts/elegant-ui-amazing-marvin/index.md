I've been tickled by how delightful Amazing Marvin's user experience is. The developers of Amazing Marvin consistently go above and beyond implementing features. They carefully tailor the experience for the user, sometimes eschewing common design patterns and adding their own flare for even the smallest interactions. If you're looking for a task management system I highly recommend giving https://amazingmarvin.com/ a try.

I've particularly been taken aback by the task list UI. Specifically, the UI makes it easy for the user to feather in new items in the order that they'd like them to be in.

## Example

## Why this is an elegant ui

### Fewer number of steps

The typical task list will have one or two points in the UI to add.

### Less context switching
