## What I'm thinking about

### Family

Jessica spent her time up in Idaho from 2022/01/20 until 2022/01/30 visiting. She stayed with Allyanna and I for the most part with some visits down to Fruitland.

It was a nice opportunity to catch up with my middle sister. There have been so many miles and so many years between us; to say I missed her doesn't quite fill the hole in my heart. The most beautiful part about having that hole filled was how easily we fell back together. There were plenty of late nights of stories and an unhealthy amount of wine consumption.

Thankfully we were able to catch a few moments while she was up here.

I had the pleasure of showing her a book that my dad filled out. It has a question and answer format about various formative and seemingly trivial aspects of his life. I caught her perusing the book while she was watching over my new great niece Maya along side her newfound friend Velo.
