I've come to develop a tradition for myself over the last few years. Normally I wouldn't consider myself a traditional
person. I hate doing things for the sake of doing them. Yet, I've found that there's nothing wrong with establishing
your own traditions as long as there's good reason.

Well I've found myself asking friends, family and strangers two questions on their birthday. I find birthdays arbitrary
in nature, but they are a great way to review milestones and celebrate life. So, out of somewhat selfish reasons, I
figured I would try to distill or extract the most valuable things that a person has learned within the last year, for
my own benefit of course. I mean, imagine if you could distill the knowledge of all of your close friends and family
into a guide for yourself. Imagine all the concepts and learnings that you could apply to your own life. Wouldn't you do
the same?

So here they are, the two questions I ask at every birthday:

> What's your favorite memory from the last year?

> What's the most important thing that you learned in the last year?

I love both of them because they're both simple. One is intellectual, usually, and the other is emotional. The first
question allows you to pry at the most formative moments of the last year while the other gives you some concrete
takeaways.

I've become known for asking these questions enough where even I receive the same queries each year.

Here are my responses for last year:

## My response from last year

> Allyanna: What's your favorite memory from the last year?

> Me: When we were on our mountain bike ride with Velo and seeing him look up at me.

> Allyanna: What's the most important thing that you learned in the last year?

> Me: That when someone acts in a way that's surprising to you in the moment, but it aligns with the way they've behaved
> in the past

Here are the responses from Albert Wintermote (my parner (Allyanna Wintermote's father)) for this year:

## Albert's response from this year

> Me: What's your favorite memory from the last year?

> Albert: The birth of our new grandson Zahir and the relationship with his mother.

> Me: What's the most important thing that you learned in the last year?

> Albert: This one is more work related. I've grown to understand with my new supervisor that I need to grow and push
> in my role in my own ways.
