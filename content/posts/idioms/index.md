Hello there,

This is my third attempt at trying to get a blog going. You know what they say, "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again." Well, this is me trying again. Let's hope "the third time's the charm".

My current goal is to write about once a week about various topics. This will be where I'll discuss everyday topics about software and the software development process as well as stories from my everyday life.
