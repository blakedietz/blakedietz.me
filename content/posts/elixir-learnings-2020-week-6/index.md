## Elixir

### iex

```bash
export ERL_AFLAGS="-kernel shell_history enabled"
```

### Posts

#### A proposal for an Absinthe application structure

Found that [this][graphql-project-structure] was a really helpful discussion on better splitting up your project structure.

### Books

#### Elixir in action

I'm a huge fan of looking at multiple sources to help solidify my foundtaional knowledge. I've heard good things about [this book][elixir-in-action]. I've started reading chapter 5 to make sure I understand GenServer and OTP a little bit more.

### Modules

#### elixslx

Full fledged library for generating xlsx files for reports if you need to.
