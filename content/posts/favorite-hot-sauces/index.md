Favorite hot sauces:

## Heartbeat hot sauce: red habanero

You can put this stuff on anything: sandwiches, soup, empandas, you name it. It' sweet, has just enough of a kick.

## Torchbearer sauces: Son of zombie wing sauce

This sauce is a bit warmer than the red habanero, but is super savory. I love using it in breakfast burritos.
