One of my personal learning goals was to brush up on operating systems. I've heard nothing but high praises about [OSTEP](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Three-Easy-Pieces-ebook/dp/B00TPZ17O4), so
I picked it up. While studying through, I felt like supplementing my reading with lectures. It turns out that one of
the authors has the lectures on YouTube, but they're unlisted, so you can't search for them. After digging
I found his course [site](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/Discussion/videos.html), which
includes his lectures, discussions and some associated code and notes.
