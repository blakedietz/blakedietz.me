In a [previous post](https://blakedietz.me//blog/2020-07-15/two-questions), I discussed a tradition that I've formed 
over the last few years. Here are may answers for this year.

### What's your favorite memory from last year?

#### Short answer

Posing on Harrison boulevard with Allyanna.

#### Long answer

During Halloween of 2019, Allyanna and I were celebrating at her sister's house on Harrison Boulevard in Boise. It's the place to be during Halloween as it's the primary street that everyone in the area visits. On average we've counted about ~2000 visitors each year.

Well, this year Allyanna and I both dressed up as Guy Fawkes. I wouldn't rank this as a scary costume, but Allyanna and I both found that the younger crowd were thoroughly creeped out by the getup as we were both handing out candy.

During a break from handing out candy, Allyanna and I thought it would be fun to go up to the attic to stand at a window directly above the area where candy handouts took place. We would stand like statues in the window, sometimes only moving once detected by the crowd as they lined up to take their turn to get some treats. We had done this in previous years to great success, but we felt like we weren't quite riling up the crowd as well as we had.

So, to change things up, we decided to make our way outside. Allyanna and I took an exit through the side yard to the front where everyone was walking by. We slowly walked up to the area where the line was formed and stood amongst some of the zombie statues that were placed in the landscape.

Allyanna and I then continued with our statuesque stances. To our surprise, we began scaring people to the point where we started getting a crowd. We even had a few people that were so thoroughly tickled that they even wanted to come take photos with us, the masked marauders.

It's one of my favorite memories, because it was so pure. There was no-premeditation or planning and it was playful to the point of almost being childish. It was a moment that my partner and I still cherish. I wouldn't have wanted to share a time like that with anyone else.

### What's the most important thing that you learned in the last year?

There's a difference between knowledge and wisdom.
