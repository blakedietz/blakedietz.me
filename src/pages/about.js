    <p>
      I'm a software developer that lives in Boise, ID. I have a
      <a href={"https://instagram.com/allyan_na"}> partner</a> and a{" "}
      <a href={"https://instagram.com/velo.dog"}>pupper</a> that I spend my
      spare time with. I'm a life long learner, that spends way too much time
      tinkering. My hobbies include vintage pen restoration, keyboard building,
      mountain biking, kombucha brewing, lifting and rock climbing.
