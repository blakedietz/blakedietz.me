      <h5>Team: Developer experience </h5>
      <p>
        I was responsible for creating a seamless development experience for a
        team of 90+ engineers with a primary focus on the backend. Challenges
        included transitioning the full team of developers from SVN to git,
        creating continuous delivery, integration and deployment pipelines in
        Kubernetes while also streamlining all aspects of the development
        process.
      </p>
      <h4> 2018/01/11 - 2019/03/01 </h4>
      <h5>Team: Core</h5>
      <p>
        Adopted and advocated for React as the frontend technology of choice for
        all frontend feature development at TSheets. Projects and
        responsibilites included the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Acted as a consultant for feature development in React and Redux to
          encourage best practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communicated with both designers and developers to build a shared
          design system and library so developers could focus on feature
          development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduced boilerplate and encouraged best practices by creating
          generators for frontend features.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created a single step setup process for developers to register their
          new projects with the CI/CD pipeline.
        </li>
        <li>
          Empowered developers to create npm packages by creating a streamlined
          workflow for repositories to be automatically and semantically
          versioned and published based upon commit format.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ran multiple new hire trainings for React and Redux development
          practices.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2016/10/31 - 2017/10/30</h4>
      <h5>Team: Scheduling</h5>
      <p>
        While on the scheduling team I identified the need to develop more
        quickly with fewer mistakes. Our frontend codebase was extremely
        susceptible to the CACE principle and I felt React's emphasis on
        declarative ui and simple state flow helped to address some of the
        problems that caused the CACE issue. I wrote the first feature in React
        and helped grow the learnings that I took from integrating React into
        the product into a plan for the rest of the organization to use.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented the first feature in React at TSheets.</li>
        <li>
          Extended the scheduling application to support more rich notification
          support.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixed complex performance and printing bugs with legacy browsers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I volunteered for a local music festival for a few years. This helped to
        scratch my itch to learn about deploying to AWS while also deploying a
        cross platform mobile application and getting a sneak peak at the artist
        lineups.
      </p>
      <h4>2017/08 - 2017/10</h4>
      <p>
        Continued to maintain and tune the backend API. Successfully served over
        one million requests throughout the duration of the festival.
      </p>
      <h4>2016/10 - 2017/03</h4>
      <p>
        Built, maintained and deployed a backend api to AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and
        API Gateway. Helped to maintain the mobile application from the previous
        year.
      </p>
