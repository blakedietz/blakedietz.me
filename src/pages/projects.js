    <h2>kbd-prettier</h2>
    <p>Make your keyboard layouts pretty &#x2328;&#xFE0F;&#x1F485;&#x2728;.</p>
    <p>
      This tool automatically makes your keyboard layout uniform. That&apos;s
      right, no more updating your layouts by hand after you make changes. Just
      create a layout in the layouts.json file and add the necessary directives
      to your layout blocks then run the script against the keymap you want to
      prettify. For an added bonus, add a watcher script to your editor of
      choice to have the layouts get automatically prettified upon save.

    <h2>Treefort music fest</h2>

    <p>
      I worked on the Treefort music festival mobile application and backing api
      for a few years as a volunteer.
    </p>
    <h3>Built and deployed serverless apis</h3>

    <p>
      I wrote the backing api in AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and APIGateway. During the
      last two years the api handled over 1m requests within the festival
      timeframe each year. The api had an etl process that gathered backing
      data. There was also a ci/cd pipeline for each environment to enable
      iterative feature development.
    </p>
    <h3>Hybrid application development</h3>

    <p>
      I helped write the first iteration of the application in the Ionic
      framework. We were tasked with maintaining and rewriting the application
      and decided to go with a hybrid solution. This allowed us to write code
      that was deployed to both iOS and Android.
